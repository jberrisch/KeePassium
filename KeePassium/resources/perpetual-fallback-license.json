As soon as you stop paying, you would lose access to the premium features. Even if you supported the app development for years, you would not have anything to show for it. This seems unfair."

In other words, if your monthly subscription is cancelled after 12 or more months, the date of your perpetual license is the cancellation day minus 12 months. The idea is the same as for the annual subscription, but paid in 12 installments."
